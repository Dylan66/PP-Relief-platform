echo "     DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=your_email@example.com"
echo "     DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=your_secure_password"
echo "   - Set CREATE_SUPERUSER=true (only for the first deployment, remove after successful creation)"
echo "   - Commit the changes to your repository"
echo "   - Push to the repository connected to Render"
echo "   - Render should automatically deploy the updated code"
echo "   - After successful deployment, REMOVE the DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD for security"
echo ""
echo "2. For the frontend (Vercel):"
echo "   - In the Vercel dashboard, add the following environment variable:"
echo "     VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://pp-relief-backend.onrender.com/api/"
echo "   - Commit the frontend changes to your repository"
echo "   - Push to the repository connected to Vercel"
echo "   - Vercel should automatically deploy the updated code"
echo ""
echo "3. To verify the changes are working:"
echo "   - Visit https://pp-relief-platform-cg1m.vercel.app/diagnostics"
echo "   - Use the diagnostics page to test API connectivity, CORS, CSRF, and authentication"
echo "   - Check the browser console for detailed error messages"
echo "   - Verify API calls are going to the correct backend URL"
echo "   - Try logging into the admin at: https://pp-relief-backend.onrender.com/admin/"
echo ""
echo "4. Common deployment issues and solutions:"
echo "   - If CORS errors appear, double-check CORS settings in the backend"
echo "   - If authentication fails, ensure the token is being properly stored and sent"
echo "   - Ensure environment variables are properly set in Vercel"
echo "   - Check application logs in both Render and Vercel dashboards"
